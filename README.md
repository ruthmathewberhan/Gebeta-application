 This website is designed to guide how to cook any Ethiopian cuisine.  It provides recipes for different Ethiopian dishes and videos on how to make them. 
 Users can search for recipes of foods or drinks by name or ingredient. There will be different classifications of the recipes, such as foods served for lunch/breakfast/dinner, vegan/non-vegan, and fast foods. Users can also review a recipe and share their thoughts on one's cooking through a public chat on the website.
Users can register to our website as a chef or simply a member who wants to view recipes. 
The chefs are going to create recipes and videos which will be sent to the administrator. If the administrator approves, the recipe will be posted to the website.

This website is built using C# language, .Net framework for the front end, and SQL and Rest API for the back end.
